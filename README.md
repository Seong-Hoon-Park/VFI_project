# Abstract
Video Frame Interpolation is a technique used to increase the frame rate of a video by inserting appropriate image frames between two consecutive frames. It can be applied in various fields of video processing and is an actively researched area. Traditional methods of video frame interpolation simply adjust the transparency of two frames and overlap them, or capture the movement of objects and synthesize the pixels in those areas. However, images interpolated using such methods tend to lack clarity, often resulting in a simple overlapping of two frames. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the performance of video frame interpolation using adaptive convolution, which is considered state-of-the-art, and apply fine-tuning to adapt it for game video.
